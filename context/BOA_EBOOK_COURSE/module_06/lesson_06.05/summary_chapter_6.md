# Summary

In this chapter, a multitude of topics have been covered. The discussion began by examining various methods for deploying applications. Using VPS or housing is possible if a custom configuration for the server is desired. Consequently, optimal configuration of Qwik with Fastify was explored. It was also analyzed and discovered that Node.js clusters enable scaling of server instances with ease.

Beyond custom server configurations, simpler solutions are available. Using a Cloud platform can significantly reduce workload at a minimal cost, and these platforms often come with enticing free tiers. These platforms also provide a plethora of monitoring and configuration services. Considering the use of external services like Sentry would still require payment for the service. So, why not utilize what is already provided with the Cloud solutions? These solutions allow deployment across numerous environments with ease. Therefore, various methodologies for versioning source code have been examined. Lastly, with the application served via the `https` protocol, supporting the Progressive Web App mode, much like other major companies in the sector, can be considered.

It has been observed that Qwik is essentially already prepared for this mode, enabling support for mobile devices in an optimal manner. In the next chapter, exploration will be done on how to manage the application state within a Qwik application and how to style an application to make it visually appealing.
