# Summary

This summary marks the end of this in-depth overview of Qwik, I enjoyed being able to share with you my passion for the frontend ecosystem and I am sure that, thanks to the notions learned, you will immediately be able to write Qwik applications with extreme confidence.
In this chapter, we have seen together a little of the history of Qwik, the framework as mentioned is a new concept and can be seen from the fact that it uses all the latest technologies to make working with it fast and pleasant. Continuing we saw how easy it is to integrate React components within our Qwik application, with the `qwikify$` core API the integration is smooth. We can delay the hydration process and thanks to the service worker pre-download the JavaScript in a secondary thread to reduce the hydration problem and improve the experience for our users. But you can't only integrate React; thanks to the community, many other integrations have been created that allow us to insert various frameworks within Qwik. Throughout the chapter, we saw that the community created the integration with Astro. If you are already using Astro, you can include Qwik components to enrich the developer experience. It will be easier to make our Astro pages dynamic. The end user will also thank you because you will get an increase in responsiveness.
We discussed possible strategies on how to migrate our applications to Qwik and I gave you some advice on how to "sell" this technology choice to your managers or bosses. Don't forget that if you want to grow as a senior developer, you can't be stopped by the fact that your company is not interested in changing or using other technologies, you have to be the one to roll up your sleeves, look around and experiment.
We have seen that Qwik also has a unique feature compared to all other frameworks, it can manage micro-frontends without the use of external libraries because out of the box, its architecture lends itself to this approach. Furthermore, we will also solve the well known problem of micro-frontends, too much JavaScript sent to the browser.
In the end, we saw that if we want to manage our projects as a monorepo, I would say that Nx is the best choice to automate a whole series of boring and time-consuming tasks. A tool like Nx allows us to make them transparent.

## Final thoughts

I take this opportunity to thank `Miško Hevery` from the bottom of my heart for writing the foreword of this book and for believing in me from the first moment we met. It was June 2022 when we were both speakers at a conference. In the speaker's room, Miško was reviewing his talk because he would soon present Qwik to the public. That occasion was the first or perhaps one of the very first times he showed Qwik to the audience. I had the pleasure of seeing the framework in a private demo with him while he was going over the features to show during his talk. It was exciting to see his passion for development and technology. In addition to him, it is also thanks to the excellent [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) team and the Qwik community that we can now enjoy a truly sensational framework. Today Qwik is a completely community-driven project and this makes it independent in terms of development and decisions. The present and future of this framework is bright.

I hope you enjoyed reading `Qwik in Action` and that the knowledge you learned in this book will help you make better future decisions. I wanted to leave you with a thought that came to me while writing this chapter. We have seen that the idea of Qwik started from afar. So, if we have an idea, we must not give up at the first difficulties because maybe it is just the wrong time to implement it. If we have passion and perseverance, we can make it possible.

Best wishes, Giorgio.
