# Summary

In this chapter, many concepts that are often overlooked or insufficiently examined have been explored. The analysis began by examining how search engines index web applications. However, it was learned that the algorithms that evaluate and compile the results are not public. Therefore, based on experience and the information shared directly by users, algorithm owners, or SEO experts, the necessary adjustments to the web application can be made.

With Qwik, there is an advantage because the search engine dedicates a limited amount of time to each site. Being able to return pages quickly gives an edge. Offering interesting and attractive content is the fundamental basis for keeping users satisfied. Consequently, the `bounce rate` and `dwell time` metrics also benefit from this. These metrics calculate how much time users spend on the platform or whether they leave after a few seconds. This provides search engines with crucial information because it indicates that the search result (e.g., the web application) is valid and can be suggested again in the reliable results for other users.

To facilitate the scanning of the application, it has been learned that the use of semantic HTML is very important. Based on the tags used, what the HTML will contain can be implicitly understood. For instance, it is known that the nav tag will contain the HTML for navigation. This aids not only search engines but also screen readers, which many people use to consume web content. This allows for full accessibility and inclusivity to everyone. Moreover, the issue of accessibility is increasingly important because there are very specific laws worldwide that require public sites to be accessible to ensure equal opportunities for all.

It's been learned that special attributes in links can be used to communicate intentions explicitly to search engines. The structure and importance of the `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` files were also examined. These files can improve the position in the SERP.

During the chapter, an introduction was made to an innovative library, Partytown, which can manage the execution of third-party scripts using the web worker. This is crucial for offloading the main thread of the browser. By doing this, there will undoubtedly be better Web Vitals, another topic of this chapter. Web Vitals are a series of metrics that analyze the application and help understand if a good experience is being provided to the user. Three main metrics are most important to monitor and optimize, but the others are also not to be overlooked. Search engines consider all these metrics when indexing the application and determining its ranking in user searches.

Some tips for improving these metrics were also learned. Fortunately, with Qwik, there won't be problems achieving the maximum scores in all the above categories. This is because Resumability and the best practices that the Qwik team encourages to follow help achieve exceptional results, which are difficult to attain with other frameworks.

In the last part of the chapter, the difference between lab data and field data was discussed. These types of data serve different purposes, primarily to understand why the application does not have good indexing. Field data are particularly useful because they record the real use of the application and provide a global view under different hardware and network conditions. The next chapter will explore how to deploy the Qwik application and discover the advantages of cloud deployment versus on-premise server deployment.
