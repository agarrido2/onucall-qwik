# Introduction

Nowadays, the frontend developer has a well-defined role, but in the past, this was not the case because the applications were simpler both graphically and in terms of functionality, and once you had mastered HTML and CSS, you could already start creating something that was deemed adequate for most cases.

In the past, the first web applications were simple pages; they were static documents, and when the user visited a page, he initiated a client-side request, which was then managed by a server. The web server prepared the page, and during the page creation phase, it could also query a database, returning a result that was then displayed in the user's browser, so the browser contacted the web server with an HTTP call and then returned the response that contained the calculated results. Therefore, this process allowed the creation of interactive experiences for users who, for example, could navigate the application and modify data via links, buttons, and forms. This process was the standard for the time but limiting because the technologies used were not up to modern solutions and involved a roundtrip of information and manipulation that left room for improvements.

With the arrival of JavaScript in 1995, the possibility of adding dynamism to the web page was born, validating inputs and hiding or showing elements without performing the previously seen roundtrip between Client and Server with the advantage of a fast and pleasant user experience. From this moment on, evolution continued to make great strides forward, with different ways of making the web application interactive, but in 2005, a turning point came with the birth of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML) because its "asynchronous" nature allowed to communicate with the server, exchange data and update the page without having to refresh the page, this made the application faster and more responsive to user actions.

The constant evolution of Web APIs that continues today has allowed the creation of increasingly interactive interfaces and the ability to communicate with external services very easily; this has given rise to increasingly interactive applications, graphically beautiful and useful because there is the ability to incorporate many more features. Now, you can create real web applications, mobile applications that often have user experiences similar to native ones, applications for smart TVs, IoT devices, and much more. Today, the limits imposed by browsers are light years away from what was once possible; now, the responsibility of creating good or bad applications depends on you because the means available are all there; you need to know how to identify them and apply them consistently to master them.
