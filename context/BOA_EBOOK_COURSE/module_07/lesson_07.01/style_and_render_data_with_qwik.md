# Style and render data with Qwik

The style and ease of use of applications are critical to ensuring that the application gains traction and becomes recognized as the standard for a given domain. You can have the best application logic, but if it is not easy to use or graphically unappealing, no one will use it, and your work will be in vain. Let's imagine having a car-sharing application where you can rent cars, book rides, make payments, know the location of the vehicle in real-time, and much more. On the server side, many variables and logic need to be taken into consideration; just monitoring where a particular vehicle is located in real-time is very complex; let's imagine calculating the rates and checking their future availability. Therefore, on the backend side, the best technologies will be used, and many hours of effort will be spent to understand, analyze, and implement everything in the best possible way. A large part of the budget is aimed at these activities, but if your users are unable to make a booking or, even worse, they are unable to register them on the platform, you can imagine that your business will be affected.

One way to limit this problem is to conduct research by interviewing stakeholders to produce the best possible user experience. One of the next steps is certainly to carry out A/B testing with similar products. This will allow us to immediately receive feedback on the positive and negative aspects, and to correct the application to obtain the best user experience.

Finally, on the graphic side, you can also try to produce modern interfaces that make the use of the application itself captivating and pleasant to unleash the famous "wow effect" in your users.

## Stakeholder engagement

To understand how to design an application, it is important to know who will use it, and therefore, it is essential to interview users to understand their needs. So, suppose you are designing a back-office application. In that case, you can think of starting from the users of the same to carefully map the processes they are currently using to perform certain operations.
To encourage alignment and dialogue between everyone, it is usually necessary to try to organize meetings with several people, up to a maximum of 7/8 people. It will be your task to understand their needs, and you will have to be careful that everyone can say their opinion.

Sometimes, there are shy people within the group; there are different skills and roles. Your task is to try to involve all the people interested in the application process that you want to analyze, always keeping in mind that everyone's ideas are useful, but if there is a person present who has more decision-making power, it is clear that he will have the final word.
It is very important at this stage to focus on the problems or slowdowns that the current flow is causing. The idea is to be able to improve it and make work easier after the introduction of the application. Time-consuming activities such as copying and pasting from one document to another are usually the most time-consuming and prone to human error tasks, and therefore, automating them is certainly a huge benefit for your stakeholders. It would not make sense to cause more slowdowns or problems with the new solution, and therefore, it is very important to be able to collect as much information as possible.

Thanks to this type of analysis, you will be able to get a very precise idea of the various screens that the application must contain, and you will also be able to draw the various flows.

## Wireframes

Once you have well-mapped the flow you want to implement, you can move on to creating the first application screens, also called Wireframes.
These Wireframes are coarse-grained graphic interfaces that are used to validate the design of information and interactions. In this phase, you should not worry about whether the primary color of your application is better, red or blue, but you should focus on interactions without worrying about stylistic aspects.
These first graphical interfaces will be shared with the customer as soon as possible to validate the assumptions and immediately seek feedback from the platform users. It will then be an iterative process that will gradually be refined to lead to the creation of a more fine-grained interface that will lead us to the final solution. In the meantime, as the focus is on the most concrete solution, the domain entities to implement will also emerge. So, from this first purely design-oriented activity, you can slowly move on to the implementation of the code.

With this general overview, you have scratched the surface of this process and allowed you to understand that immediately starting to write code for your application is not the best choice. Many activities can be implemented to clarify the application domain and the needs that your users have. If you don't have the opportunity to interview your users because the application is aimed at the general public, you can implement other strategies. You can analyze the competitors to understand what flows and functions they all have in common, and then, based on those, you can give your approach to the application. Another viable option is to carry out a market analysis on a significant number of users to gather as much information as possible and start your process.
